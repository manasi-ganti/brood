# brood (brewed)
inspired by imissmycafe.com and lofi.cafe

current features:
ambient noise, two backgrounds, music

features to come:
more backgrounds, more ambient noise options, better graphics, hopefully an actual live site (also cleaner code lmao)


## Instructions
### 1. Download
Download the github code as a zip file (and unzip, obviously).
If you don't want to go even touch Terminal/Command line, from here you can just double-click index.html to open it in your browser, but most of the music won't work.


#### 2. Set up local HTTP server.
Open your Terminal app and navigate to the downloaded folder: `cd Downloads/brood-main`
Start the HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
(If you have Python 3: `python3 -m http.server`)

#### 3. Visit website.
Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser. Most of the functionality is pretty straightforward. The videoId is the id of a youtube video (the stuff after "?v=" in the link).
